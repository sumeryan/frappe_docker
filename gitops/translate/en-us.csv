Permissions Error
Permissions are automatically applied to Standard Reports and searches.
Permissions are set on Roles and Document Types (called DocTypes) by setting rights like Read, Write, Create, Delete, Submit, Cancel, Amend, Report, Import, Export, Print, Email and Set User Permissions.
Permissions at higher levels are Field Level permissions. All Fields have a Permission Level set against them and the rules defined at that permissions apply to the field. This is useful in case you want to hide or make certain field read-only for certain Roles.
Permissions at level 0 are Document Level permissions, i.e. they are primary for access to the document.
Permissions get applied on Users based on what Roles they are assigned.
